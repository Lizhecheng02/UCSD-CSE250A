All solutions are presented in this repository and can be useful for learning.

### Final Exam
An 80-minute in-class exam with 10 true/false questions, two multiple-choice questions, and four major problems related to application and calculation. No mathematical proofs are needed. The four major problems include variable elimination, the EM algorithm in HMMs, the use of the forward algorithm in HMMs, and policy-value-based reinforcement learning.
